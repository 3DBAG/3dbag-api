description: |-
  Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected.
  The bounding box is provided as four numbers:

  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1 (min. x)
  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2 (min. y)
  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1 (max. x)
  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2 (max. y)

  The default coordinate reference system is Amersfoort / RD New, EPSG:28992
  (https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992).
  Currently only `https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992` is supported as `bbox-crs`.
