  description: |-
    The [3DBAG](https://3dbag.nl) is an up-to-date data set containing 3D building models of the Netherlands. 
    The 3DBAG is open data. It contains 3D models at multiple levels of detail, 
    which are generated by combining two open data sets: 
    the building data from the BAG and the height data from the AHN. 
    The 3DBAG is updated regularly, keeping it up-to-date with the latest openly 
    available building stock and elevation information.
    
    The 3DBAG is maintained by tudelft3d and 3DGI.

        Either a date-time or an interval. Date and time expressions adhere to RFC 3339.
        Intervals may be bounded or half-bounded (double-dots at start or end).

        Examples:

        * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
        * A bounded interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
        * Half-bounded intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"

        Only features that have a temporal property that intersects the value of
        `datetime` are selected.

        If a feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the

                Extensions may support additional areas.
                The first bounding box describes the overall spatial
                extent of the data. All subsequent bounding boxes describe
                more precise bounding boxes, e.g., to identify clusters of data.
                Clients only interested in the overall spatial extent will
                only need to access the first bounding box in the array.

              items:
                description: |-
                  Each bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on
                  whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis
                  (height or depth):
  
                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
                  * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
                  * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
  
                  If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate reference system is
                  WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84)
                  unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in `crs`.
  
                  If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system is WGS 84
                  longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)
                  unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in `crs`.
  
                  For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
                  minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
                  However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
                  (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).
  
                  If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
                  the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.
  
                  If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
                  server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
                  the extent or all relevant geometries.

        The response is a document consisting of features in the collection.
        The features included in the response are determined by the server
        based on the query parameters of the request. To support access to
        larger collections without overloading the client, the API supports
        paged access with links to the next page, if more features are selected
        that the page size.
        
        The `bbox` parameter can be used to select only a
        subset of the features in the collection (the features that are in the
        bounding box). The `bbox` parameter matches all features
        in the collection that are not associated with a location, too.

        The `limit` parameter may be used to control the subset of the
        selected features that should be returned in the response, the page size.
        Each page includes information about the number of selected and
        returned features (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as
        links to support paging (link relation `next`).
