  description: |-
    The [3DBAG](https://3dbag.nl) is an up-to-date dataset containing 3D building models of the Netherlands. 
    The 3DBAG is open data. It contains 3D models at multiple levels of detail, 
    which are generated by combining two open data sets: 
    the building data from the BAG and the height data from the AHN. 
    The 3DBAG is updated regularly, keeping it up-to-date with the latest openly 
    available building stock and elevation information.
    
    The 3DBAG is maintained by 3D GeoInformation group and 3DGI.

        An array of extents is provided for each extent type (spatial, temporal). The first item
        in the array describes the overall extent of the data. All subsequent items describe more

                Extensions may support additional areas.
                The first bounding box describes the overall spatial
                extent of the data. All subsequent bounding boxes describe
                more precise bounding boxes, e.g., to identify clusters of data.

                  Currently only `https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7415` is supported as `crs`.
    
                  If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
                  server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
                  the extent or all relevant geometries.

    Features:

        The response is a document consisting of features in the collection.
        The features included in the response are determined by the server
        based on the query parameters of the request. To support access to
        larger collections without overloading the client, the API supports
        paged access with links to the next page, if more features are selected
        that the page size.
        
        The `bbox` parameter can be used to select only a
        subset of the features in the collection (the features that are in the
        bounding box). The `bbox` parameter matches all features
        in the collection that are not associated with a location, too.

        The `limit` parameter may be used to control the subset of the
        selected features that should be returned in the response, the page size.
        Each page includes information about the number of selected and
        returned features (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as
        links to support paging (link relation `next`).
